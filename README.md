# Programs to train the basics of Python
Beginning projects developed from [Iury Rosal](https://www.youtube.com/@IuryRosal)'s classes with the purpose of putting Python knowledge into practice.

## 🔨 Projects functionality

### 1 - Quiz 📋
Questionnaire designed for the user to test some of his theoretical knowledge of Python.

#

### 2 - Guess number 🔢
Program for the user to guess the number generated by the random module.

#

### 3 - Rock, paper, and scissors 👊🖐️✌
Recreating the game Jokenpô (Rock, paper, and scissors), in which the user plays against the computer.

#

### 4 - Timer ⏱️
Project designed to run a countdown from the time chosen by the user.

#

### 5 - Password generator 🔑
The program is designed to make it easy for the user to create a strong, random password when needed.

#

### 6 - Guess the dates 📅
The game is designed to train the user's knowledge, in which he must guess the dates of certain historical moments.

### 8 - Detect palindromes 🔄
The program designed to test whether words are palindromes, i.e. you can read from left to right or vice versa.

### 9 - Aquarium manager 🐠
The project was developed with the intention of filtering and mapping the data in an aquarium. To do this, some dummy data in JSON format was used to place all animals of the type "fish" in the tank number 42. In addition, another program was created within this folder to be able to how many animals of each type are in the aquarium.

### 10 - NBA Data 🏀
The program consists of displaying some of the key data of NBA teams and games from the consummation of an API.
